## ✅ What is AWS?

AWS stands for **Amazon Web Services**.
It’s a collection of online tools that help people and companies run websites, apps, and store data — without needing to buy their own computers.

Imagine you want to start a website or app.
Instead of buying a big computer (called a **server**), setting it up, and maintaining it, you just **rent** those computers from AWS over the internet. Simple, right?

### 🧠 Real-Life Example:
Think of AWS like **electricity or water**.
You don’t build your own power plant at home. You just use electricity when you need it and pay for what you use.

AWS works the same way — you use computing power, storage, or tools when you need them and pay only for what you use.
